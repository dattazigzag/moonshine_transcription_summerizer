## Description

A multi-agent, privacy-first pipeline that transforms raw `.rtf` meeting transcripts from [Moonshine.ai](https://note-taker.moonshine.ai/) into polished, corporate-grade meeting minutes using local LLMs (like Gemma4 and Qwen) via Ollama.

## Overview

Generating high-quality meeting minutes locally from 45+ minute transcripts is challenging. Passing a raw `.rtf` file with a single massive system prompt to a ~27B parameter local model often results in cognitive overload, hallucinated action items, and dropped details. 

**Our Solution:** We break the problem down into a **5-step chained pipeline**. By isolating tasks—cleanup, human-in-the-loop speaker identification, data extraction, and final formatting—we can achieve "Google-level" summary quality using local, consumer-grade hardware while keeping sensitive corporate data 100% private.

## Key Learnings & Architecture Decisions

During the development of this pipeline, several critical discoveries shaped the architecture:

1. **RTF Noise vs. Markdown:** Raw RTF tags consume thousands of wasted tokens and confuse LLMs. Stripping the RTF into explicit Markdown (`**Speaker 1:** text`) acts as an anchor, helping the model perfectly distinguish between the speaker and the dialogue.
2. **The "Human-in-the-Loop" Necessity:** LLMs frequently hallucinate action-item ownership if speakers don't explicitly name themselves. A fast, non-LLM CLI prompt to map generic tags (e.g., "Speaker 1") to real names (e.g., "Andro") eliminates this risk entirely.
3. **Extraction vs. Formatting:** Asking an LLM to extract data *and* format it into tables simultaneously leads to data loss. We split this: Agent 2 acts as a "Data Harvester" (extracting exhaustive, categorized bullets), and Agent 3 acts as the "Publisher" (formatting the dense data into clean tables and lists).
4. **Model Nuances (Gemma vs. Qwen):** * **Gemma (~27B)** excels at natural language smoothing and narrative flow but needs strict structural guides.
   * **Qwen (~27B)** is highly logical but tends to over-compress. It requires "negative constraints" (e.g., *CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: DO NOT summarize away technical details*) to ensure high data fidelity.
   * *Solution:* The pipeline uses **Dynamic Prompting**, automatically switching the internal system prompt based on the `--model` argument passed in the CLI.
5. **VRAM Optimization:** We utilize the `keep_alive=-1` parameter in the Ollama API to keep the LLM loaded in VRAM across the sequential scripts, drastically reducing execution time.

## Prerequisites

* **Python 3.8+**
* **[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)** (Python package manager)
* **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)** running locally or on your network (Default expects: `http://<YOUR OLLAMA IP>:11434`)
* **Local Models:** Pull your preferred models in Ollama:
  
  ```bash
  ollama pull gemma4:26b
  ollama pull qwen3.5:27b
   ```

## The 5-Step Pipeline Workflow

### Step 1: Parse RTF to Markdown (Non-LLM)

Strips noisy .rtf formatting and groups consecutive speech into clean Markdown and JSON (_not used in further processing currently_).

```bash
uv run 01_convert_rtf.py transcripts/<MeetingTranscript>.rtf --out-dir output/raw_files/
```

### Step 2: Agent 1 - Transcript Cleanup

The LLM acts as a **Data Cleaner**.

It proofreads the raw markdown, removes verbal stutters, false starts, and filler words without summarizing or losing chronological context.

```bash
uv run 02_agent1_cleanup.py output/raw_files/<MeetingTranscript>.md --out-dir output/cleaned_files/
```

### Step 3: Speaker Mapping (Human-in-the-Loop)

A quick CLI script that scans for `Speaker X:` tags and pauses to ask you for their real names. 

It then performs a global find-and-replace, ensuring 100% accurate attribution for the subsequent AI steps.

```bash
uv run 03_speaker_mapping.py output/cleaned_files/<MeetingTranscript_cleaned>.md --out-dir output/named_files/
```

### Step 4: Agent 2 - Information Extraction

The LLM acts as a **Data Harvester**. 

It scans the named transcript and extracts exhaustive, high-fidelity bullet points, organizing them into logical H3 sub-categories while preserving specific metrics, dates, and brands.

```bash
uv run 04_agent2_extraction.py output/named_files/<MeetingTranscript_named>.md --out-dir output/extracted_files/
```

### Step 5: Agent 3 - Final Formatting

The LLM acts as the **Publisher**. 

It takes the dense extraction and formats it into a professional layout, generating a "Participants" list and organizing Action Items into a strict Markdown table `(Task | Owner | Status)`.

```bash
uv run 05_agent3_formatter.py output/extracted_files/<MeetingTranscript_extracted>.md --out-dir output/final_summaries/
```

## Advanced CLI Usage

All AI agents (02, 04, 05) support CLI overrides for the model and the host URL. The scripts will automatically detect if you are using a Gemma or Qwen model and apply the optimized system prompt.

> [!Warning] 
> As of April, 2026, the internal system prompts are tailored to `gemma4:26b` and `qwen3.5:27b`. If using a different model or even same family models with higher or lower weights, you might need to adjust the system prompts via experimentation or develop / tweak affordance of the respective agent scripts.
